# Text-Based RPG Game

A simple text-based RPG game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This is a learning project completed as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) JavaScript curriculum. The goal is to build a functioning game engine that can be extended with new features and mechanics in future versions.

## Features

- Basic RPG mechanics:
  - Health, gold, and experience (XP) tracking
  - Weapons with increasing power
  - Inventory system
  - Monster fights with random attack logic
- Locations:
  - Town square (hub area)
  - Store (buy/sell mechanics)
  - Cave (multiple enemies)
  - Final boss fight (dragon)
- Additional gameplay:
  - Hidden Easter egg mini-game
  - Weapon durability (weapons can break)
  - Game win and loss conditions
- Responsive interface using only simple DOM manipulation (no libraries)

## Game Flow

1. Start in the town square.
2. Choose to visit the store, fight monsters in the cave, or go straight to the dragon.
3. Buy weapons and health using gold earned from battles.
4. Fight increasingly strong monsters and gather XP.
5. Win the game by defeating the dragon — or lose if your health drops to zero.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (basic layout/styling)
- JavaScript (vanilla DOM and game logic)

## Planned Features

This project will be extended with new mechanics in the future, including but not limited to:

- Player leveling system
- Special skills and abilities
- More enemy types and areas
- Inventory item types (armor, potions, spells)
- Simple quest system
- Save/load progress using localStorage
- UI improvements and animations

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Use the buttons to navigate, fight monsters, and progress through the game.
